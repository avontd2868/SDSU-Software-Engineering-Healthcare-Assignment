SDSU Software Engineering Healthcare Assignment
===============================================

Welcome to the best group ever. If you have never used github before, google "github on \*your OS\*" and you should get some initial instructions.

You are going to want to clone this project to your computer and work from that directory, adding them committing changes when you make them. Please make your commit messages very clear; don't be afraid of saying too much.

How to run this on your local computer:

First, make sure you have a web server running. 

Windows: XAAMP (or WAMP)
  Your htdocs folder will likely be in C:\xaamp (wamp)\htdocs
  You will want to clone this project into your htdocs folder (and you may want to give it a shorter name)
  At some point you will want to install a sql program (HeidiSQL works great for windows)
  Once the files are in place, before we use DB access, simply browse to localhost:(xaamp or wamp port)/(folder you put the files) and you should see the project.

Mac: MAMP
  Install, your htdocs folder will be at Applications/MAMP/htdocs
  Clone the repo into that folder (make the name something more browser friendly)
  Install SequelPRO (its the easiest, best program for free SQL interaction on MAC)
  If MAMP is running, you should be able to browse to the site at localhost:(MAMP defaults to 8888)/(folder you put the files)

Linux:
  Install LAMP, basically follow instructions above, find your own SQL program, or use PHPMyAdmin (I love linux, but I think if you're using it you're probably smart enough to set this up.)

If you have problems send me a PM on github or an email @ aaron@aaron-lee.me. I usually respond pretty quickly.
